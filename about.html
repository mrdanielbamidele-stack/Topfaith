            <p class="title"> About the school</p>
            <p>At Topfaith School, we believe that excellence is not an option—it’s a lifestyle. Founded on the principle that every child carries a spark of genius, our mission is to create an environment where curiosity thrives, innovation is celebrated, and character is shaped with care.

            Over the years, Topfaith has grown from a humble idea into a thriving institution recognized for its creative teaching methods, outstanding academic performance, and a culture of discipline blended with compassion. Our classrooms are more than four walls—they are laboratories of imagination, where students are encouraged to question, explore, and discover their unique talents.

            <p class="title"> About the vice chancelor</p>
            <p>Professor Dr. Augustine K. Tobi (Vice Chancellor)
               Professor Augustine K. Tobi has served as the Vice Chancellor of our institution since 2018. Known for his unique ability to remember the name of every student he meets (even if they only say it once), he has become both a mentor and a friendly face around campus.

               He holds a PhD in “Applied Common Sense” from the University of Imagination, where he graduated top of his class for discovering how to balance a chalkboard on two fingers. Under his leadership, the school has broken world records such as “Most Students Smiling at Once” and “Fastest Assembly Ever Dismissed.”

               When he is not making policies, he enjoys long walks across the campus—usually to make sure the Wi-Fi is working—and giving motivational speeches that often include quotes he invents on the spot.
